// The single, shared Collie mark: brand + home button + connection loader in one, so the top-left of
// every screen means the same thing. ONE element in all three states — <CollieMark/>, which is a
// still drawing while live, starts turning (the "bloom") once the connection has been not-live for a
// sustained beat (`trouble`), and goes still again, muted, once the outage escalates (`lost`). That
// is why this no longer swaps a sprite for a still image: the old sprite had no rest frame (frame 0
// is a full-stretch mid-stride pose that reads as frozen mid-run), so rest had to be a different
// picture. This mark rests by not animating at all, so nothing is ever swapped and nothing can
// resize as the connection settles.
// The mark is now the app's ONLY animal: the boot splash and the idle cover bloom this same mark, so
// "Collie is fetching" looks the same wherever it appears. <DogGallop/> is untouched but no longer
// mounted anywhere in the app (see components/dog-gallop.tsx).
//
// Tapping it returns to the dashboard. The dashboard shows the "Collie" wordmark too; inside a pane
// the mark stands alone (the breadcrumb carries the context). Both headers render THIS component —
// the consistency is structural, not a convention two files have to keep agreeing on.

      {/* No ring, no disc: the badge existed because the old sprite was a transparent cut-out that
          floated on the bar. This mark carries its own ring — the orbit IS the frame — and a
          40px circle with `overflow-hidden` would clip the beads that pass widest. The box keeps
          its size-10 geometry, because the header row is sized by it (see AppHeader).

          `paper` is the header's own ground, which is `bg-background` (app-header.tsx — chrome is
          the page colour, separated by a rule, not a fill). It is the colour of the knockout that
          makes a near-side bead read as being IN FRONT of the head; anything else shows up as a
          halo around those beads, so this value tracks the ground and is not a taste choice. The
          two are COUPLED and the coupling is easy to forget, so app-header.test.tsx fails if the
          header's background utility and this prop ever name different tokens.

          Muted while lost — grayscale + dimmed, to read asleep/inactive — and the orbit stops
          turning again. Mirrors the boot splash's not-connected state. */}
