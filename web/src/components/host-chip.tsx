// ── THE HIDE RULE LIVES HERE, NOT IN THE CALLERS ─────────────────────────────
// Renders `null` when the pack is a single machine — i.e. for every install that exists today —
// which is why callers may mount it unconditionally. If each caller had to ask "am I on a pack?"
// first, a solo install would eventually grow a stray chip and, far worse, a pack install would
// eventually drop one at the surface that mattered.
//
// ── AND WHY IT IS NEVER THE SESSION SWITCHER'S TWIN ──────────────────────────
// Two lookalike pills, one changing machines and one changing sessions, is a mis-tap waiting to
// happen (milestone constraint). So this is deliberately NOT a control: no tap target, no chevron, a
// server glyph rather than the switcher's layers, and it is a plain text node — a host name comes
// from the operator's `join` label and is rendered as text, never markup, like every other
// user-supplied string that reaches this UI.

  // TIER 2, and only tier 2: this chip degrades when the LEAD can't reach this member. It says
  // nothing about whether the phone can reach the lead — that is the header pill, the banner and the
  // dog, all reading one shared clock, and duplicating their answer here is how two surfaces start
  // disagreeing about the same outage. An unlisted host (a member that departed while you were
  // looking at it) resolves to `unknown` rather than being dropped or quietly assumed healthy.
  //
  // ── AND WHY THE CONDITION IS `writable`, NOT `state !== "live"` ──────────────
  // `state === "stale"` is a statement about the AGE of the lead's receipt, never a verdict on the
  // machine (lib/host-health.ts). This chip used to degrade on `state !== "live"` alone and append
  // "(unreachable)" with it, so a peer answering every request — its receipt merely older than the
  // sweep's cadence — was announced down to a screen reader, beside a composer that was accepting
  // sends. The dashed border and the word are the same fact as the refusal: the lead's plain
  // boolean, unsmoothed, exactly what `writeRefusal` gates on. Absent health on a pack is a departed
  // member, which is not writable either.
  const unreachable = !health?.writable;
  // ONE condition drives BOTH the styling and the label, so the two can never drift into a chip that
  // looks fine and reads down (or the reverse). The word itself is narrower than the styling: only
  // `!writable` may spell "unreachable".
