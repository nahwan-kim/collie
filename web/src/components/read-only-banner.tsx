// The app's "you can look, but you can't type" strip, covering BOTH write gates — they are
// independent on the bridge and compose by AND, so either one alone puts this device in the same
// place, and one strip is the honest surface for it. Renders nothing when neither gate refuses, so
// it still costs nothing on a normal single-user deployment.
//
//   · Header gate (`device`, from the snapshot): a fronting proxy asserts who this device is and the
//     bridge doesn't have it allowlisted. Nothing on the phone can fix it.
//   · Pairing gate (lib/pairing.ts): this device holds no bearer token, or the one it holds was
//     rejected. Fixable right here, which is why this variant names the remedy. It is LATCHED off a
//     real refusal rather than polled, because reads are ungated — a poll can never discover it.
