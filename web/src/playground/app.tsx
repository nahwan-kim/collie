// The states playground: every UI state Collie can reach, on one page, without having to provoke the
// condition that produces it. DEV-ONLY — see `web/playground.html`.
//
// THE RULE THIS PAGE KEEPS: it mounts the REAL components with their REAL props, and where a state
// is derived from a module store instead of a prop it drives that store through the store's own
// exported mutators. Nothing here is a copy of a component, and no component was given a prop it
// does not already have. Where that was not possible the card says so in its own words.
//
// THE OTHER RULE: every card carries a "reach it for real" line. A picture of a state is only useful
// if you can also get to it, and writing that sentence is what keeps a card from drifting into a
// state the app can no longer produce.
