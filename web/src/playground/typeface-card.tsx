// The UI typeface comparison. DEV-ONLY, like everything else under src/playground/.
//
// WHY THIS CARD BREAKS THE PAGE'S "MOUNT THE REAL COMPONENT" RULE, ON PURPOSE. Every other card
// mounts real components with real props. This one cannot: the whole point is to see FOUR faces at
// once, and there is only ever one app. So the specimen below is a rebuild of the app's own chrome —
// the header and wordmark, a section label, status chips, a settings row, buttons, and the
// counts-heavy list that is most of the dashboard — using the same sizes, weights, tracking and
// tokens the real components use. It is a stand-in, and it says so on the card.
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR. F-D1 says the UI typeface is the maker's choice and ships with no setting, so this
// page is the only place the call gets made. Judge it at the 11px uppercase tracked label and at the
// 18px wordmark, on a phone, in BOTH themes — that is where these three faces actually differ. The
// counts column is there because the dashboard is full of "14m", "(6)", "p1", and a face whose
// figures are proportional makes that column jitter row to row.
//
// The two faces the app does not ship are declared in playground.css, not index.css: index.css names
// exactly what the service worker caches (lib/sw-routes.ts FONT_URLS), and it must not grow entries
// for files a shipped build never asks for.
